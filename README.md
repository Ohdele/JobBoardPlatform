# Job Board Platform

# Project Setup

## Overview
Create a job board where users can post job listings and apply for jobs. This project includes:
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Frontend**: JavaScript (React)
- **Additional Features**: Java (notifications, advanced search)

## Project Structure
- `frontend`: Contains React application code.
- `backend`: Contains Flask application code.
- `java-services`: Contains Java code for additional features.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ohdele/JobBoardPlatform.git




## Backend Development (Flask)

### Overview
I focused on setting up the backend for the JobBoardPlatform project using Flask. This involved initializing a Flask project, configuring the environment, installing necessary packages, and creating initial files for the project structure.

### Backend Setup

1. **Initialize Flask Project:**
   - Created a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activated the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Installed Flask:
     ```bash
     pip install Flask
     ```

2. **Created Initial Files:**
   - `app.py`: Main application file that initializes Flask and sets up the home route.
   - `auth.py`: Handles user authentication routes (e.g., login, registration).
   - `config.py`: Contains configuration settings for the Flask application (e.g., database URI).
   - `models.py`: Defines database models (e.g., User, Job Listings) using SQLAlchemy.
   - `test_auth.py`: Contains unit tests for authentication routes.
   - `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

This reflects the steps I have completed in the backend setup so far.


## Database Setup

This section outlines the steps to set up the database for the project. Proper database setup is crucial for ensuring that the application functions correctly and securely.

1. **Install Necessary Packages**

   Install the required Python packages for database interaction. This step ensures that you have all the dependencies needed for database operations.

2. **Configure MySQL**

   Ensure that MySQL is properly configured on your system. Create a new database and user with appropriate permissions to manage the database. This setup will allow the application to connect and interact with your database.

3. **Create Models for Users, Job Listings, and Applications**

   Define the data models in the `backend/models.py` file. These models represent the core entities of the application: User, Job Listing, and Application. Each model corresponds to a table in the database and includes fields relevant to the application’s functionality.

4. **Migrate Database**

   Initialize the migration setup and apply the initial migrations to create the database schema. This step involves generating migration scripts and applying them to ensure that the database schema is up-to-date with the application’s requirements.

5. **Commit and Push Changes to GitHub**

   After completing the database setup, commit all changes and push them to GitHub. This includes the updated models and migration files. This practice ensures that your code is version-controlled and available for collaboration.

6. **Handle Source Control Issues**

   Resolve any issues with source control by checking for untracked or modified files. Ensure that all necessary files are added, committed, and pushed to GitHub. This step helps maintain a clean and organized repository.

By following these steps, you ensure that your database is correctly set up and integrated with your application. This process is vital for smooth development and deployment.
