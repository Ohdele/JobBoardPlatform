# Job Board Platform

# Project Setup

## Overview
Create a job board where users can post job listings and apply for jobs. This project includes:
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Frontend**: JavaScript (React)
- **Additional Features**: Java (notifications, advanced search)

## Project Structure
- `frontend`: Contains React application code.
- `backend`: Contains Flask application code.
- `java-services`: Contains Java code for additional features.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ohdele/JobBoardPlatform.git




## Backend Development (Flask)

### Overview
I focused on setting up the backend for the JobBoardPlatform project using Flask. This involved initializing a Flask project, configuring the environment, installing necessary packages, and creating initial files for the project structure.

### Backend Setup

1. **Initialize Flask Project:**
   - Created a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activated the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Installed Flask:
     ```bash
     pip install Flask
     ```

2. **Created Initial Files:**
   - `app.py`: Main application file that initializes Flask and sets up the home route.
   - `auth.py`: Handles user authentication routes (e.g., login, registration).
   - `config.py`: Contains configuration settings for the Flask application (e.g., database URI).
   - `models.py`: Defines database models (e.g., User, Job Listings) using SQLAlchemy.
   - `test_auth.py`: Contains unit tests for authentication routes.
   - `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

This reflects the steps I have completed in the backend setup so far.




## Database Setup

1. Install Necessary Packages

To set up the database, first install the required Python packages using the following commands:

pip install SQLAlchemy psycopg2-binary


2. Configure PostgreSQL/MySQL

Ensure that PostgreSQL or MySQL is properly configured on your system. You will need to set up the database and user credentials.


# psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;"
# psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER myuser WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'mypassword';"
# psql -U postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydatabase TO myuser;"


3. Create Models for Users, Job Listings, and Applications

Create models in the `backend/models.py` file. Here's a summary of what each model represents:

- **User**: Represents a user in the job board platform.
- **Job Listing**: Represents job listings available on the platform.
- **Application**: Represents job applications made by users.

```python
# backend/models.py

from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(db.Model):
    # Define fields

class JobListing(db.Model):
    # Define fields

class Application(db.Model):
    # Define fields



4. Migrate Database

Run the following commands to initialize and migrate the database:

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade


5. Commit and Push Changes to GitHub

After completing the setup, commit and push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add backend files and migrations"
git push origin main


6. Handle Source Control Issues

To resolve any issues with source control:

```bash
# Check for untracked or modified files
git status

# Add the necessary files
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push the changes to GitHub
git push origin main
